# microservice-autoscaling-mdp
These are the formalized energy-driven microservice autoscaling policies developed using a PRISM model checker tool. The models are specified in Markov Decision Process (MDP) and verified with properties specified in Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL). The models exists in two version: single-node version, and multiple-node version.
